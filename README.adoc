Automates time-consuming tasks contributing metadata to BookBrainz and MusicBrainz.
Ever find it a hassle to add large series of works bo BookBrainz or MusicBrainz?
This project tries to make it easier to automate such things.

== How it Works

DriverBrainz is just a Python project that drives a web browser using Selenium to automate adding series of works to BookBrainz and MusicBrainz.

== Getting Started

This project uses Nix to manage all of the Python dependencies as well as the Selenium webdriver.
The instructions here are intended for Linux

. Install {just} by following the instructions in the https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#installation[installation section].

. Clone this project's repository.
+
[,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/jwillikers/driverbrainz.git
----

. Change into the project directory.
+
[,sh]
----
cd driverbrainz
----

. Update the code as necessary with details of the series.

. Run driverbrainz with `just run`.

== Development

The following instructions describe how to set up a local development environment and perform development tasks.

=== Development Environment

It's possible to use a development environment from {Nix} or from a standard Python virtual environment.
Both methods are described in the following sections.

==== Nix

I've added development environment and some helpers using {Nix}.
The `nix develop` command can be used to enter or run commands in an environment with all of the necessary dependencies.
For convenience, direnv can be used to automatically load this environment when entering the project's directory.
The https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mkhl.direnv[mkhl.direnv VSCode extension] integrates this environment in VSCode for development.
Nix also generates the configuration for {pre-commit}, which automates formatting and various checks when committing changes.
Follow the instructions here to set up your development environment using Nix.

. Install an implementation of {Nix}, such as https://lix.systems[Lix] used here.
+
[,sh]
----
curl -sSf -L https://install.lix.systems/lix | sh -s -- install
----

. Install direnv for your system according to the https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html[direnv installation instructions].
+
[,sh]
----
sudo rpm-ostree install direnv
sudo systemctl reboot
----

. Integrate direnv with your shell by following the instructions on the https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html[direnv Setup page].

. Permit the direnv configuration for the repository.
+
[,sh]
----
direnv allow
----

. Modify the `driverbrainz.py` script to suite your needs.

. Run the `driverbrainz.py` script.
+
[,sh]
----
nix develop --command ./driverbrainz.py
----
